# Notes

## Definition

React Three Fiber (R3F) is a React library that allows you to build and manage 3D graphics in a web browser using Three.js, a popular 3D rendering library. Instead of writing raw Three.js code, which can be complex, React Three Fiber provides a way to use familiar React concepts (like components, props, and hooks) to build and interact with 3D scenes more easily.

- useMemo hook
- Sharing Objects
- Stats Panel
- R3F-Perf
- OrbitControls

Oct 3
- `<PointerLockControls />`: creates a first person view
- `<axisHelper />`: adds colorful lines at x y z
- `<gridHelper />`: adds a grid
- Liva: a GUI component to interact with scene 

Oct 4
- Materials
  - MeshBasicMaterial: Use when lighting is unnecessary and you want a flat, simple color/texture.
  - MeshNormalMaterial: Use for debugging or if you want a stylized, geometric look that highlights the 3D shape.
  - MeshPhongMaterial: Use when you want shiny, glossy surfaces with highlights.
  - MeshStandardMaterial: Use for the most realistic material that interacts with light as real-world objects do, with control over roughness and metalness.
- Lights
  - Ambient Light: Provides uniform lighting across the scene, illuminating all objects equally without casting shadows.
  - Directional Light: Simulates sunlight by emitting parallel rays from a specific direction, casting shadows and highlighting surfaces.
  - Point Light: Emits light in all directions from a single point, similar to a light bulb, with falloff over distance.
  - Spot Light: Casts a focused beam of light in a specific direction, like a flashlight, often used for highlighting specific areas or objects.
- Shadows

Oct 8
- useLoader -  used in React Three Fiber to pre-cache any assets in memory, uses a texture module in the example
- GLTFLoader - used to load 3d models, uses an example from blender
- Environment - creates a background and creates reflections on 3d models

Oct 9
- Advancing GLTF scenes - The glTF specification provides a way to describe whole scenes which may include a large hierarchy of other 3D objects, as well as lighting, animations, materials, textures, skeletons, morph targets, cameras and even other scenes.

Oct 10
- useGLTF - create models in blender and export them as glb files. Models are loaded dynamically using the useGLTF hook.
- annotations - Dreiâ€™s Html component allows you to place HTML elements within the 3D scene and have them interact seamlessly. You can add these annotations directly in Blender by embedding metadata (like userData) into the model. For each relevant part of the model, you can add a prop property to the userData, which stores the annotation text.
- GLTFJSX - GLTFJSX is a command line tool that will read through a glTF model, and extract its components into a JSX equivalent.
